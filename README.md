# Title: Impact of Reference Database on Bioinformatic Pipelines 


Originally, this project was going to focus on pipeline choice an how that may impact eDNA analyses. 
Unfortunately, I could not get either pipeline working, so now we are going to look at the impact of reference databases on eDNA analyses 
I will be comparing data provided by the company Jonah Ventures and analyses that I conducted in cutadapt, DADA2, and Insect 
This code is only relevant to my bioinformatic steps, but the R analyses that I do are for both the Jonah Ventures and Insect results p
I will include the Jonah Ventures steps on my Github page 

First we are going to start by creating a file that has the names of all our samples
my samples are named like this: JV193_UniCOI_GlassJessica_S050295.2.R2.fastq
the code below will remove everything after the "2", so samples will look like this: JV193_UniCOI_GlassJessica_S050295

The code that I ran can be found in Final_analysis_694

The remainder of the items are figures that I made with the data
